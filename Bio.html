<p>
John Zweck is a Professor in the Department of Mathematics at New York Institute of Technology. He obtained a B.Sc. with honours from the University of Adelaide, Australia in 1988 and a Ph.D. in mathematics from Rice University in 1993. After several short term positons, Dr. Zweck became an Assistant Professor at the University of Maryland Baltimore County where he was granted tenure in 2006. From 2012-2024 he was a Professor of Mathematical Sciences and an Affiliate Professor in the Department of Science/Mathematics Education at the University of Texas at Dallas. He joined NYIT in 2025.
</p>

<p>
At UT Dallas, Dr. Zweck collaborated with faculty colleagues and over 30 graduate teaching assistants and 60 undergraduate learning assistants on a small group active learning method for the calculus III course he coordinated. While solving problems together in small groups, students learn to communicate mathematics with each other, construct conceptual frameworks that will enable them to tackle future challenges in science and engineering, and grow their ability to learn mathematics for themselves. Dr. Zweck also designed a collection of 3D-printed models of curves and surfaces that students use to enhance their conceptual understanding and improve their geometric visualization and problem solving skills.
</p>

<p>Over the last three decades, Dr. Zweck's research has ranged from theoretical work in differential geometry and analysis to more applied collaborations on the development of theory, models, and numerical algorithms for the computational simulation of fiber lasers, plasmas, trace gas sensors, and optical fiber communications systems. This combination of theory and applications informs his classroom teaching.
</p>

<p>
Over the last twenty five years Dr. Zweck has been the principal or co-principal investigator on almost 4 million dollars in funding, mostly from the National Science Foundation, that has supported his research and teaching innovations. He has been awarded two U.S. patents, has over 90 research publications, and received the President's Teaching Excellence Award in Undergraduate Instruction at UT Dallas in 2022. In 2023, he received the University of Texas System Regents Outstanding Teaching Award.
